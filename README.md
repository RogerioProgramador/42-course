# 42-course

This repository contains all the essential projects required to complete the core curriculum at 42. Each project helps build a strong foundation in various programming concepts and skills, preparing students for advanced topics and professional development.

## Projects

### [Libft](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-libft.git)
The Libft project involves creating a custom library in C, replicating standard functions from the C library, and implementing additional useful functions. This project strengthens your understanding of fundamental C programming concepts and prepares you for future projects.

### [ft_printf](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-ft_printf.git)
In this project, you will recreate the `printf` function from the C standard library. This involves handling various data types, flags, and formatting options, improving your skills in variadic functions and formatted output.

### [get_next_line](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-get_next_line.git)
The goal of this project is to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one at a time. It helps you practice dynamic memory allocation and file I/O operations in C.

### [Minitalk](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-minitalk.git)
Minitalk is a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. You will create a client-server system, allowing the client to send messages to the server. This project introduces you to inter-process communication.

### [Push_swap](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-push_swap.git)
Push_swap involves sorting a stack of integers with a limited set of operations. You will develop sorting algorithms and optimize them for performance. This project enhances your understanding of algorithm efficiency and stack operations.

### [Philosophers](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-philosophers.git)
In this project, you will simulate the dining philosophers problem, a classic synchronization problem. It involves managing threads and avoiding deadlocks, deepening your knowledge of concurrent programming.

### [Minishell](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-minishell.git)
Minishell requires you to create a simple shell that can execute commands, handle environment variables, and manage processes. This project helps you understand how command-line interfaces and process management work.

### [Cub3D](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-cub3d.git)
Cub3D is a 3D game engine project inspired by Wolfenstein 3D. You will implement raycasting to create a first-person view environment. This project teaches you the basics of computer graphics and game development.

### [Inception](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-inception.git)
Inception focuses on setting up a multi-container Docker environment. You will create and manage containers for various services, gaining skills in containerization and orchestration.

### [one_file_printf](https://github.com/RogerioProgramador/42-one_file_printf.git)
This project is similar to ft_printf but with additional constraints, requiring you to implement the function in a single file. It challenges your ability to write concise and efficient code.
